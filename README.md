## 📦 MVP

- Monitor transactions for N wallets via RPC
- Send transactions to AI analyzer
- Receive risk score and reasoning
- Display all events on a dashboard
- Optional Telegram/Discord alerts for high-risk activity

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Execute testnet transactions based on AI recommendations
- Multi-chain monitoring (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.)
- Fine-tuned anomaly detection models
- Wallet activity memory for context-aware reasoning
- Natural language agent interface for queries

---

## 📚 Usage

1. Configure monitored wallet addresses in `config.yaml`.
2. Set up RPC node credentials (Alchemy, Infura, etc.).
3. Start the Go listener to fetch transactions.
4. Start the Python AI analyzer service.
5. Deploy the dashboard and connect to AI analyzer endpoints.
6. View live monitoring data and insights via the web dashboard.

## 💡 Notes

- Currently designed for testnets or simulated environments.
- Supports integration with Telegram/Discord for real-time alerts.
- Fully modular and extensible for AI, blockchain, and front-end improvements.
